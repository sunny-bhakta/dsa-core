**Navigation:** [Home](../../README.md) | [Previous: Sliding Window](../20-sliding-window/README.md) | [Next: Interview Questions](../22-interview-questions/README.md)

## Overview
Two pointers technique uses two pointers moving through a data structure to solve problems efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Types
- **Opposite Ends**: Start from both ends, move toward center
- **Same Direction**: Both start from beginning, move forward
- **Fast and Slow**: Different speeds (Floyd's cycle detection)

## Patterns

### Opposite Ends
- Used for sorted arrays
- Move pointers based on comparison
- Example: Two sum in sorted array

### Same Direction
- Both pointers move forward
- Maintain invariant between pointers
- Example: Remove duplicates

### Fast and Slow
- One pointer moves faster
- Used for cycle detection
- Example: Find middle of linked list

## Time Complexity
- Usually O(n) - linear scan

## Common Problems
1. Two sum (sorted array)
2. Three sum
3. Remove duplicates
4. Container with most water
5. Palindrome check
6. Merge sorted arrays
7. Cycle detection

## Use Cases
- Sorted array problems
- Linked list problems
- String problems
- Optimization problems
